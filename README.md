p44mbrd
=======

*[[if you want to support p44mbrd development, please consider to sponsor plan44]](https://github.com/sponsors/plan44)* 

*p44mbrd* (plan44 matter bridge daemon) is a free (opensource, GPLv3) *matter* bridge daemon, intended as a companion to the [**vdcd**](https://github.com/plan44/p44lrgraphics) home automation controller.

*p44mbrd* connects vdcd-based devices from many technologies (DALI, EnOcean, hue, SmartLEDs, and many more) into the new [smart-home standard *matter*](https://buildwithmatter.com), making them available in matter-enabled smart home "oecosystems" such as Apple Home, Smart Things, Alexa, Google and hopefully many more independent ones in the near future.

## Implementation notes

### bridge API

*p44mbrd* uses a **JSON-based representation of the [vdc API](http://developer.digitalstrom.org/Architecture/vDC-API.pdf)** to communicate with *vdcd*.

The *vdc-API* was originally defined in 2013 as an abstraction for the [digitalSTROM](https://digitalstrom.com) device model to allow integration of third-party devices into digitalSTROM. The vdc API device model was designed to be as generic as possible, with a strong focus on being self-descriptive through a [structured tree of device properties](http://developer.digitalstrom.org/Architecture/vDC-API-properties.pdf).

This now helps *p44mbrd* to obtain the needed information from devices to be able to map them to *matter bridged device*.

### matter SDK - connectedhomeip

For the implementation of the matter standard, *p44mbrd* uses the official Apache 2 licensed matter SDK which is called [connectedhomeip](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip).

In particular, *p44mbrd* was evolved out of the *bridge-app* example in CHIP.

The *connectedhomeip* is included as a submodule, but **using a plan44 forked github repository**. 

The forked version is currently needed because things like build support for OpenWrt or the libev based mainloop are not yet part of upstream *connectedhomeip*. In addition, the forked version omits a lot of very footprint heavy submodules (gigabytes!) containing SDKs for various embedded hardware not relevant to a Linux/Posix based bridge project.

However, the plan44 fork is not a real fork and will not diverge from *connectedhomeip* a lot. It's just a set of commits on top of *connectedhomeip* (currently v1.0.0) that will be rebased from time to time to new upstream releases, and hopefully over time get integrated into the SDK itself.
 
### p44utils

p44mbrd is also based on a set of generic C++ utility classes called [*p44utils*](https://github.com/plan44/p44utils), which provides basic mechanisms for mainloop-based, nonblocking I/O driven automation daemons, as well as a script language, [*p44script*](https://plan44.ch/p44-techdocs/en/#topics). p44utils is included as a submodule into this project.

## Early Beta - Work in Progress!

**This project is an early beta**! It is far from a certifiable (let alone certified) implementation, and has many gaps in functionality. Still, it works pretty nice already with Apple Home at the time of writing.

Expect a lot of changes, refactorings and additions in the next few months!

In particular, *connectedhomeip*'s (and underlying ZCL's) design is very much targeted at devices with a factory-defined static device structure defined at compile time, derived from a static data model laid out in the so-called *.zap file* generated by the *zap tool*.

A bridge and its devices however do not have a static structure, but one defined at run time. The *bridge-app* sample in the matter SDK shows some of the tricks needed to create so-called *dynamic endpoints* and implement their storage. *p44mbrd* in its current (October 2022) state is a heavily refactored and modularized version of *bridge-app*, but still using those rather arcane mechanisms available for *dynamic endpoints*.

Just recently (in the *connectedhomeip* `master` branch, not the `v1.0-branch`, a new example named `dynamic-bridge-app` has appeared which seems to address the subject in a less Q&D way than `bridge-app` did. Maybe there's things to learn from `dynamic-bridge-app`...

I also plan to look closer into *zcl/ember* implementation and maybe suggest or help extending it to better support dynamic endpoints from .zap templates instead of all the hand-woven metadata needed right now.

*p44mbrd* is licensed under the GPLv3 License (see COPYING).

If that's a problem for your particular application, I am open to provide a commercial license, within the limits of the third party code included (in particular, *connectedhomeip*'s Apache 2 License) - please contact me at [luz@plan44.ch](mailto:luz@plan44.ch).


## Getting Started

### try it out

- plan44.ch provides RaspberryPi images named P44-DSB-X and P44-LC-X which contain a complete OpenWrt, with vdcd and p44mbrd installed and fully configured as a digitalSTROM bridge or a standalone light controller with matter support. You can download these from [https://plan44.ch/automation/p44-dsb-x.php](https://plan44.ch/automation/p44-dsb-x.php), copy it to a SD Card and use it with a RPi B, B+, 2,3 and 4.

### build it

- you can build *p44mbrd* using the `gn`/`ninja` build system the same way you build any example from the *connectedhomeip* repository, e.g. as described for the bridge-app example in `src/third_party/connectedhomeip/examples/bridge-app/linux/README.md`

### run it

- on a Linux or macOS host, you can run *p44mbrd* with

    ```bash
${OUT_DIR}/p44mbrd --payloadversion 0 --vendor-id 0xFFF1 --product-id 0x8002 --setuppin 20202021 --discriminator 3842 --KVS /file/to/store/data --chiploglevel 2 --loglevel 5
    ```
  Note that at this time, all this **is not certified by the csa-iot** so must use `vendor-id` and `product-id` as shown above. These are the test vendor and bridge-app product ids from the SDK.
  The `discriminator` should be set to a device-unique value to allow commissioning in a network with multiple bridge-app or p44mbrd instances.
  
- you also need to have a *vdcd* running on the same host providing the *bridge-api* on port 4444 (default, you can define other bridge API ports, allow non-local access with *vdcd* command line options, see `--help`, and you can tell *p44mbrd* using `--bridgeapihost` and `bridgeapiport` where to look for the bridge API.
